-------------------------------

Deleting the .git folder may cause problems in your git repository. If you want to delete all your commit history but keep the code in its current state, it is very safe to do it as in the following:

    Checkout
    git checkout --orphan latest_branch

    Add all the files
    git add -A

    Commit the changes
    git commit -am "commit message"

    Delete the branch
    git branch -D main

    Rename the current branch to main
    git branch -m main

    Finally, force update your repository
    git push -f origin main

PS: this will not keep your old commit history around
