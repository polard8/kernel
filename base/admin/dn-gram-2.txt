	gramado/ folder:

	Gramado is a system for thin legacy machines and
	for storing data.

	There is no user interfce in the gramado project.
	The official interface is called gws and it is 
	a separeted project.
	It means that Gramado can run a thin legacy system
	just to provide access to the resources inside them.
	We also can run gramado on thin clients with no rich
	user interface.

	For rich clients with good graphicas support we can run the
	full system associating the gramado and gws project.
	This way gramado can run with a rich graphics window system
	and use the gui apps inside the gws project.
