// [ libio ]
// I just created a ring3 i/o library, 
// given to the ring3 processes full access to the i/o ports. Why not?!
// This way i can build new drivers in ring 3, 
// with no risk for the system. So I will only port to ring0 the well tested drivers.  


// Acesso a portas para processos em user mode.
// Será usado pelos servidores e drivers.
// O privilégio será baseado em 'usuário' e 'desktop'.

//# todo
//+ usar system_call para acessar o kernel
//+ criar lá no kernel as rotinas que atendem essa system call.


// #todo
// Essa bibliorteca poderia ter uma parte relativa
// a autorizações.

// #todo
// Precisamos checar essas chamadas ao kernel.
