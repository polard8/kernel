# libgws is a C library for building user interfaces for Gramado OS.

gws.c: 
    Client-side library for the Gramado Window Server.
    This is the client-side library linked statically
    agains the client applications.
    Here we have routines for making the requests to the server
    and getting the responses.
#todo: 
Actually we can create a library only for the 
connections and the low level routines found in this library.
